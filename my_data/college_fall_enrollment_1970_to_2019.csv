†Not applicable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
\1\Data for 2000 and later years reflect a substantial reduction in the number of Department of Defense institutions included in the IPEDS survey.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: Data through 1990 are for institutions of higher education, while later data are for degree-granting institutions. Degree-granting institutions grant associate’s or higher degrees and participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs. The degree-granting classification is very similar to the earlier higher education classification, but it includes more 2-year colleges and excludes a few higher education institutions that did not grant degrees. Some data have been revised from previously published figures. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
